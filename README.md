# Clock-think
Hello there everyone!

This is just another desktop clock created to practice my HTML, CSS and JS skills. It's a minimalistic desktop clock in blue colors, following web responsive principles, it also will be inproved in next releases. So please, feel free to use it in your own device or taking it to enhance it for your own projects.
I hope you like it.

Have a nice one c:
